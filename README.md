## Description

We have been tasked to develop a full-stack application using skills and technologies that we have been learning throughout phase 1 and 2. We have built a movie watchlist that allows users to create an account using their e-mail
username and password. A user can then login to their account and search
for movies. They can then add movies to their watchlist.

## Installation

Start by cloning the repository link to your local machine

```
$ git clone https://github.com/JosephCurtis1999/MovieWatchList
$ cd MovieWatchList
```

To install the required depencies and setup the application, run these commands in your terminal

```
$ npm i
$ source db/schema.sql
$ npm start
```

A dotenv (.env) file will need to be placed in the root directory of the project in order to connect to the database. Here is how to set it up

```
DB_NAME=project2_db
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

## Usage

Enter npm start into the terminal to start the application. Once a port has been presented in the terminal type localhost:3000 in your browser to display the application locally
